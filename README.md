# image-seg-ship-detection
Image segmentation for ship detection by DL models trained on open source high resolution sar images dataset, HRSID (COCO dataset format).
This is part of the code that I worked on as part of my student internship at NRSC.

This project utilizes the Ultralytics YOLOv8 software for object detection.
